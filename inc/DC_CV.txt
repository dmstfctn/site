Demystification Committee
chair@demystification.co


The Demystification Committee is a collaborative framework set up to investigate the globalised, extra-state, covert systems and large-scale networks, processes and technologies that shape our society.

Through artistic intervention, custom-made tools and machines, public engagement and experimentation, the Demystification Committee investigates clashing technological and societal trajectories.

Going beyond the use of specific techniques, tools or technologies, the Demystification Committee experiments with alternative narratives to the dominant myths surrounding technology and society.
