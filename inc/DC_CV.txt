Demystification Committee
chair@demystification.co


The Demystification Committee investigates deep systems of power that shape contemporary society through the study of platforms and networks, and the production of visual and sound work.

Seeking alternative narratives to the myths of late capitalism, the practice currently focuses on the relationship between sovereignty and capital, and on the friction between communication networks and infrastructures of power.

The Demystification Committee was established in 2016 and is chaired from London, UK and Berlin, DE.
