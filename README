#Dev Setup

##Javascript concatenation
Javascript is written as modules and everything is require()d to bring it
together, this means it has to be packaged before it can be used.
[Watchify](https://github.com/substack/watchify) is good.

In the root folder of the theme run:

```watchify assets/javascript/src/main.js -o assets/javascript/dist/main.js```

##Javascript Minification
Optionally minify it before distribution/upload. No pro way of doing this, just
minify however you want (online is easy) and then paste it into dist/main.js.

##CSS
The CSS is written naked, no preprocessors, no modularisation. It's a huge file.
Good luck.
